        <h2>Formation and early years (1984–1990)</h2>
        <p>Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament were members of grunge band Green River during the mid-1980s. Green River
          toured and recorded to moderate success but disbanded in 1987 due to a stylistic division between the pair
          and bandmates Mark Arm and Steve Turner. In late 1987, Gossard and Ament began playing with Malfunkshun
          vocalist Andrew Wood, eventually organizing the band Mother Love Bone. In 1988 and 1989, the band recorded
          and toured to increasing interest and found the support of the PolyGram record label, which signed the band
          in early 1989. Mother Love Bone's debut album, Apple, was released in July 1990, four months after Wood died
          of a heroin overdose. Ament and Gossard were devastated by the death of Wood and the resulting demise of
          Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had
          been doing previously. After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike
          McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament.
          After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a
          drummer. They gave former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons the demo to see if he would be interested
          in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position. Irons
          passed on the invitation but gave the demo to his basketball friend, San Diego, California singer Eddie
          Vedder.Vedder was the lead vocalist for a San Diego band, Bad Radio, and worked part-time at a gas station.
          He listened to the tape shortly before going surfing, where lyrics came to him. He then recorded the vocals
          to three of the songs ("Alive", "Once", and "Footsteps") in what he later described as a "mini-opera"
          entitled Momma-Son. Vedder sent the tape with his vocals back to the three Seattle musicians, who were
          impressed enough to fly Vedder up to Seattle for an audition. Within a week, Vedder had joined the band.
          With the addition of Dave Krusen on drums, the band took the name Mookie Blaylock, in reference to the
          then-active basketball player.The band played its first official show at the Off Ramp Café in Seattle on
          October 22, 1990. They opened for Alice in Chains at the Moore Theatre in Seattle on December 22, 1990 and
          served as the opening act for the band's Facelift tour in 1991. Mookie Blaylock soon signed to Epic Records
          and renamed themselves Pearl Jam. In an early promotional interview, Vedder said that the name "Pearl Jam"
          was a reference to his great-grandmother Pearl, who was married to a Native American and had a special
          recipe for peyote-laced jam. In a 2006 Rolling Stone cover story however, Vedder admitted that this story
          was "total bullshit", even though he indeed had a great-grandma named Pearl. Ament and McCready explained
          that Ament came up with "pearl", and that the band later settled on "Pearl Jam" after attending a concert by
          Neil Young, in which he extended his songs as improvisations of 15–20 minutes in length.</p>

        <h2>Ten and the grunge explosion (1991–1992)</h2>
        <p>Pearl Jam entered Seattle's London Bridge Studios in March 1991 to record its debut album, Ten.
          McCready said that "Ten was mostly Stone and Jeff; me and Eddie were along for the ride at that time."
          Krusen left the band in May 1991 after checking himself into rehabilitation; he was replaced by Matt
          Chamberlain, who had previously played with Edie Brickell & New Bohemians. After playing only a handful of
          shows, one of which was filmed for the "Alive" video, Chamberlain left to join the Saturday Night Live
          band. Chamberlain suggested Dave Abbruzzese as his replacement. Abbruzzese joined the group and played
          the rest of Pearl Jam's live shows supporting Ten.
          Released on August 27, 1991, Ten (named after Mookie Blaylock's jersey number) contained eleven tracks
          dealing with dark subjects like depression, suicide, loneliness, and murder. Ten's musical style, influenced
          by classic rock, combined an "expansive harmonic vocabulary" with an anthemic sound. The album was slow
          to sell, but by the second half of 1992 it became a breakthrough success, being certified gold and reaching
          number two on the Billboard charts. Ten produced the hit singles "Alive", "Even Flow", and "Jeremy".
          Originally interpreted as an anthem by many, Vedder later revealed that "Alive" tells the
          semi-autobiographical tale of a son discovering that his father is actually his stepfather, while his
          mother's grief turns her to sexually embrace her son, who strongly resembles the biological father. In this
          lyric, even though Vedder originally looked at "being alive as a curse," as the sadness the speaker in the
          song suggests, "...But as fans quickly turned the title phrase into a self-empowering anthem, particularly
          at Pearl Jam concerts, Vedder said, "they lifted the curse. The audience changed the meaning for me," he
          told VH1 Storytellers in 2006.
          The song "Jeremy" and its accompanying video were inspired by a true story in which a high school student
          shot himself in front of his classmates. Ten stayed on the Billboard charts for nearly five years, and
          has gone on to become one of the highest-selling rock records ever, going 13x platinum.
          With the success of Ten, Pearl Jam became a key member of the Seattle grunge explosion, along with Alice in
          Chains, Nirvana, and Soundgarden. The band was criticized in the music press; British music magazine NME
          said that Pearl Jam was "trying to steal money from young alternative kids' pockets." Nirvana's Kurt
          Cobain angrily attacked Pearl Jam, claiming the band were commercial sellouts, and argued Ten was not a
          true alternative album because it had so many prominent guitar leads. Cobain later reconciled with
          Vedder, and they reportedly were on amicable terms before Cobain's death in 1994.
          Pearl Jam toured relentlessly in support of Ten. Ament stated that "essentially Ten was just an excuse to
          tour," adding, "We told the record company, 'We know we can be a great band, so let's just get the
          opportunity to get out and play.'" The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, "Once people came and saw
          them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening and there
          was no stopping it." Early on in Pearl Jam's career, the band became known for its intense live
          performances. Looking back at this time, Vedder said that "playing music and then getting a shot at making a
          record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...But it didn't come from jock
          mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates."
          In 1992, Pearl Jam made television appearances on Saturday Night Live and MTV Unplugged and took a slot on
          that summer's Lollapalooza tour with Ministry, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Soundgarden, among
          others. The band contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the 1992 Cameron Crowe film Singles:
          "State of Love and Trust" and "Breath". Ament, Gossard and Vedder appeared in Singles under the name
          "Citizen Dick"; their parts were filmed when Pearl Jam was known as Mookie Blaylock.</p>

      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h2>Vs., Vitalogy and dealing with success (1993–1995)</h2>
        <p>The band members grew uncomfortable with their success, with much of the burden of Pearl Jam's popularity
          falling on frontman Vedder. While Pearl Jam received four awards at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards for
          its video for "Jeremy", including Video of the Year and Best Group Video, the band refused to make a video
          for "Black" in spite of pressure from the label. This action began a trend of the band refusing to make
          videos for its songs. Vedder felt that the concept of music videos robbed listeners from creating their own
          interpretations of the song, stating that "Before music videos first came out, you'd listen to a song with
          headphones on, sitting in a beanbag chair with your eyes closed, and you'd come up with your own visions,
          these things that came from within. Then all of a sudden, sometimes even the very first time you heard a
          song, it was with these visual images attached, and it robbed you of any form of self-expression." "Ten
          years from now," Ament said, "I don't want people to remember our songs as videos."

          Pearl Jam headed into the studio in early 1993 facing the challenge of following up the commercial success
          of its debut. McCready said, "The band was blown up pretty big and everything was pretty crazy."
          Released on October 19, 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, Vs., sold 950,378 copies in its first week of
          release and outperformed all other entries in the Billboard top ten that week combined. The album set
          the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release, which it held until broken by
          Garth Brooks' 1998 album, Double Live. Vs. included the singles "Go", "Daughter", "Animal", and
          "Dissident". Paul Evans of Rolling Stone said, "Few American bands have arrived more clearly talented than
          this one did with Ten; and Vs. tops even that debut." He added, "Like Jim Morrison and Pete Townshend,
          Vedder makes a forte of his psychological-mythic explorations... As guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike
          McCready paint dense and slashing backdrops, he invites us into a drama of experiment and strife." The
          band decided, beginning with the release of Vs., to scale back its commercial efforts. The members
          declined to produce any more music videos after the massive success of "Jeremy" and opted for fewer
          interviews and television appearances. Industry insiders compared Pearl Jam's tour that year to the touring
          habits of Led Zeppelin, in that the band "ignored the press and took its music directly to the fans."
          During the Vs. Tour, the band set a cap on ticket prices in an attempt to thwart scalpers.

          By 1994, Pearl Jam was "fighting on all fronts", as its manager described the band at the time. Reporter
          Chuck Philips broke a series of stories showing that Ticketmaster was gouging Pearl Jam's customers.
          Pearl Jam was outraged when, after it played a pair of charity benefit shows in Chicago, Illinois, it
          discovered that ticket vendor Ticketmaster had added a service charge to the tickets. Pearl Jam was
          committed to keeping their concert ticket prices down but Fred Rosen of Ticketmaster refused to waive the
          service charge. Since Ticketmaster controlled most major venues, the band was forced to create from scratch
          its own outdoor stadiums in rural areas in order to perform. Pearl Jam's efforts to organize a tour without
          the ticket giant collapsed, which Pearl Jam said was evidence of Ticketmaster's monopoly. An analysis of
          journalist Chuck Philips investigative series in a well known legal monograph
          concluded that it was hard to imagine a legitimate reason for Ticketmaster's exclusive contracts with venues
          and contracts which covered such a lengthy period of time. The authors said, "The pervasiveness of
          Ticketmaster's exclusive agreements, coupled with their excessive duration and the manner in which they are
          procured, supported a finding that Ticketmaster had engaged in anticompetitive conduct under section 2 of
          the Sherman Act."

          The United States Department of Justice was investigating the company's practices at the time and asked the
          band to create a memorandum of its experiences with the company. Band members Gossard and Ament testified at
          a subcommittee investigation on June 30, 1994 in Washington, D.C. Pearl Jam alleged that Ticketmaster
          used anti-competitive and monopolistic practices to gouge fans. After Pearl Jam's testimony before Congress,
          Congressman Dingell (D-Mich.) wrote a bill requiring full disclosure to prevent Ticketmaster from burying
          escalating service fees. Pearl Jam's manager said he was gratified that Congress recognized the problem as a
          national issue. The band eventually canceled its 1994 summer tour in protest. After the Justice
          Department dropped the case, Pearl Jam continued to boycott Ticketmaster, refusing to play venues that had
          contracts with the company. The band tried to work around Ticketmaster's exclusive contracts by hosting
          charities and benefits at major venues, because the exclusive contracts often contained a clause allowing
          charity event promoters to sell their own tickets. Music critic Jim DeRogatis noted that along with the
          Ticketmaster debacle, "the band has refused to release singles or make videos; it has demanded that its
          albums be released on vinyl; and it wants to be more like its '60s heroes, The Who, releasing two or three
          albums a year." He also stated that sources said that most of the band's third album Vitalogy was completed
          by early 1994, but that either a forced delay by Epic or the battle with Ticketmaster were to blame for the
          delay.
          Pearl Jam wrote and recorded while touring behind Vs. and the majority of the tracks for Vitalogy were
          recorded during breaks on the tour. Tensions within the band had dramatically increased by this time.
          Producer Brendan O'Brien said, "Vitalogy was a little strained. I'm being polite—there was some imploding
          going on." After Pearl Jam finished the recording of Vitalogy, drummer Dave Abbruzzese was fired.
          The band cited political differences between Abbruzzese and the other members; for example, Abbruzzese
          disagreed with the Ticketmaster boycott. He was replaced by Jack Irons, who had connected Vedder to
          the rest of the band some four years prior. Irons made his debut with the band at Neil Young's 1994 Bridge
          School Benefit, but he was not officially announced as the band's new drummer until its 1995 Self-Pollution
          satellite radio broadcast, a four-and-a-half-hour-long pirate broadcast out of Seattle which was available
          to any radio stations that wanted to carry it.
          Vitalogy was released first on November 22, 1994 on vinyl and then two weeks later on December 6, 1994 on CD
          and cassette. The CD became the second-fastest-selling in history, with more than 877,000 units sold in its
          first week. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that "thanks to its stripped-down, lean production,
          Vitalogy stands as Pearl Jam's most original and uncompromising album." Many of the songs on the album
          appear to be inspired by the pressures of fame. The song "Spin the Black Circle", an homage to vinyl
          records, won a Grammy Award in 1996 for Best Hard Rock Performance. Vitalogy also included the songs "Not
          for You", "Corduroy", "Better Man", and "Immortality". "Better Man" (About this soundsample), a song
          originally written and performed by Vedder while in Bad Radio, reached number one on the Billboard
          Mainstream Rock chart, spending a total of eight weeks there. Considered a "blatantly great pop song" by
          producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from Vs. due to
          its accessibility.
          The band continued its boycott against Ticketmaster during its 1995 tour for Vitalogy, but was surprised
          that virtually no other bands joined in. Pearl Jam's initiative to play only at non-Ticketmaster venues
          effectively, with a few exceptions, prevented it from playing shows in the United States for the next three
          years. Ament later said, "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our
          own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career." In the same year Pearl Jam backed Neil Young,
          whom the band had noted as an influence, on his album Mirror Ball. Contractual obligations prevented the use
          of the band's name anywhere on the album, but the members were all credited individually in the album's
          liner notes. Two songs from the sessions were left off Mirror Ball: "I Got Id" and "Long Road". These two
          tracks were released separately by Pearl Jam in the form of the 1995 EP, Merkin Ball. </p>
